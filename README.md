## The Goal

Currently, our Fantasy League is a process of manually checking web pages to see who made transfers, who scored what
points, and what people's current teams are. These are then shared into a WhatsApp group in the form of screenshots.
This floods our camera roll.

The goal of this suite of tools is to create a few APIs that can send formatted text, or screenshots, into a WhatsApp
Group at the call of a REST Endpoint.

## Active APIs

* Get Transfers
* Get League Standings Including Today's scores.
* Get Current Teams

## Pending APIs
